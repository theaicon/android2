Cookbook

Virtual Cookbook Android Application

This is a project I did over the summer. The application is a virtual cookbook intended to replace the cookbook and stand setup found in most kitchens. 

This application and all source code is owned solely by the owner of this repository. Please do not copy this code for your own projects without my permission. And of course, please DO NOT STEAL MY IDEA! (I hate it when people do that...)

Current Build Notes:
- Can read preloaded recipes
- Can rate recipes after viewing them
- Can sort recipes based on rating
- Timer Functionality

Proposed Features:
- Ability to upload recipes to a central server
- Ability to download recipes from a central server

Files:
- Source code is in the folder src/com/cookbook.
