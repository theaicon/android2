Drain the fruits from the can for at least 2 hours. This is to prevent a soggy fruit salad.
When all the juices have been drained, mix all the fruits together in a bowl.
Add the condensed milk and cream till well blended.
Transfer to serving bowls and top with peaches and cherries.
Freeze or Refrigerate properly. (Buko spoils if not refrigerated or frozen. I prefer to freeze the rest of the buko salad if it isn’t eaten within the day.)
