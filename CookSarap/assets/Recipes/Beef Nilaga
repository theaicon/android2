Nilaga is a Philippine dish that Filipinos love cooking and eating during those cold, rainy days when they just want to have a hot soup and some chunks of meat and vegetables to go with their hot steamed rice. The term nilaga translates to the word "boiled" in English. As the name suggests, this Philippine dish is prepared by boiling meat, pork or beef and vegetables, potatoes, corn, Filipino bokchoy orpechay, and yardlong beans or sitaw.
