Boil 1/2 cup thick coconut milk in a saucepan until the oil is extracted and the precipitate forms into a dark brown color. This is called latik. Drain the latik from the oil and set aside.
Grease a 13-inch rectangular dish with coconut oil. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, blend rice flour, sugar, sweet corn kernels, 1/2 cup cornstarch, and fresh coconut milk. Stir in grated buko (if used). Boil over slow heat, stirring constantly to prevent lumps, until mixture is clear for about 3-5 minutes.
Pour hot mixture into prepared dish and allow to set. Sprinkle latik on top. Cool before slicing.
When rice flour is not available, soak 2 cups rice in 2 cups water overnight. Put through blender and process until smooth.
