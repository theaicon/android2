Dessert made from boiled mashed ube (purple yam) mixed with coconut milk, evaporated milk, and sugar. In the olden days, a fine consistency was achieved by passing the mixture through a piece of sinamay. With its bright color, it is a favorite at fiestas. It is also sometimes added to halu-halo.

In a saucepan, melt the butter.
Add the grated purple yam. Mix well.
Then add the condensed milk, coconut milk and the vanilla extract.
Cook stirring continuously on medium heat until the liquid is reduced and fully absorbed by the yam for about about 5-10 minutes.
Turn the heat to medium low and continue stirring until you get a very thick consistency.
Brush your serving pan or container with butter and spread out the Halayang Ube. The butter will prevent it from sticking to the container.
Cool and refrigerate before serving.
Top with grated cheese, toasted coconut flakes or any preference.
